# AccessibleBrowser

Webcessible was an attempt to build a simplified web browser that would make browsing the web easier on people with physical disabilities. Webcessible was setup in such a way to allow for a variety of inputs to suit users with varying handicaps. 

essentially, as shown below, we have rendered the essential features of a website into a variable sized grid. This allows for a high level of configuration for varying handicaps.
